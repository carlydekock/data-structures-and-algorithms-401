# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a queue using two stacks.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Create a new PseudoQueue class, which will implement standard queue interface (two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 stack objects
- enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue using a first-in,first-out approach
- dequeue() which exracts a value from the PseudoQueue using a first-in,first-out approach
- Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Enqueue: space O(1)/time O(1)
- Dequeue: space O(n^2)/time O(n^2)
