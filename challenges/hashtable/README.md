# Hash Table Implementation
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a HashTable and methods.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- Get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- Contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- Hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- O(1) space and time for retriving and adding
