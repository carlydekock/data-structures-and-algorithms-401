# Trees

Conduct "FizzBuzz" on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree. Set the values of each new node depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

## Challenge

<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
- Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
  - If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
  - If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
  - If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
  - If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- O(n) time / O(k) space
